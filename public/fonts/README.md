# Font Installation Instructions

## Chicken Pie Font

The Chicken Pie font needs to be downloaded from DaFont and placed in this directory.

### Steps:
1. Visit: https://www.dafont.com/chicken-pie.font
2. Download the font file
3. Convert to web formats (woff2, woff) using a tool like: https://transfonter.org/
4. Place the following files in this directory:
   - chicken-pie.woff2
   - chicken-pie.woff
   - chicken-pie.ttf

### Temporary Fallback
Until the font is installed, the site will use the fallback font 'Inter' for headings.

### Alternative: Use Google Fonts
If you prefer to use a Google Font instead, you can replace the Chicken Pie font with a similar display font like:
- Righteous
- Fredoka One
- Baloo 2
- Titan One
